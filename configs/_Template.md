### Instructions

_if you are new to markdown check for more info [[here|https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet]] and [[here|https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#tags]] and [[mermaid|https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#mermaid]] for custom tags available._

Also remember that images or any attachment needed can be inserted with an easy drag & drop, preferred format png.
**Attachments are considered readonly**, so if they're live docs insert a link to the document from the corporate CMS.
